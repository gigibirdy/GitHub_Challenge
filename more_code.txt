<p>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. </p>
Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health.
Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.
Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.
